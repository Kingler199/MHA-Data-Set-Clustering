       "   It is difficult for me to find activities to spend time meaningfully.  Because of my health, there are many activities I think I cannot do anymore.  I am / was fully-prepared for retirement. If you are retired, answer this question: Retirement is what I expected it to be.  I think it is important for me to keep growing in life.  I am constantly challenging myself to achieve my goals.  It is easy and comfortable for me to talk to people in the community.  I often feel lonely.  I know of activities in the neighbourhood that I can take part in.  I feel a sense of belonging and ownership of spaces in my community. (e.g. community centres, parks, fitness corners, void decks)  I am confident to use technology to connect with people around me.
